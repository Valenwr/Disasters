# Data Analysis Project: Disaster Data Visualization
##Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize disaster data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to various types of disasters across different regions and time periods. The analysis covers data cleaning, frequency analysis of disaster types, and geographical distribution of responses, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and GeoPandas.

Objectives
Data Cleaning: To prepare raw data for analysis by removing inconsistencies and handling missing values.
Data Analysis: To analyze the frequencies of different types of disasters and responses.
Data Visualization: To visually represent the data through various charts, including bar charts, heatmaps, and time-series plots.
Insight Generation: To provide actionable insights that could aid in disaster preparedness and response strategies.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Pip (Python package installer)
Libraries Installation
Before running the project, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib geopandas seaborn numpy
Data Files
Ensure that the data files are placed in the Files directory under the project root. The main data file expected is Disasters_Large_1900.csv.

How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
Run the Script
Execute the main script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations:
bash
Copy code
python main_script.py
Features and Scripts
load_data: Loads data from CSV files.
initial_inspection: Provides an initial inspection of the loaded data.
data_cleaning: Cleans the data based on specified criteria.
frequency: Calculates the frequency of specified events.
plotter_disaster_frequency: Generates bar charts for visualizing the frequency of disaster types.
plotter_disasters_heatmap: Creates heatmaps to show the relationship between two variables.
occurrences_over_the_years: Plots occurrences of events over the years.
Visualizations
This project generates several types of visualizations to help interpret the data:

Bar Charts: Show the frequency of different disaster types.
Heatmaps: Visualize the correlation between different variables such as time and type of disaster.
Time-Series Plots: Display trends of disasters over time.
