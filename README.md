# Disaster Data Visualization
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize disaster data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to various types of disasters across different regions and time periods. The analysis covers data cleaning, frequency analysis of disaster types, and geographical distribution of responses, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and GeoPandas.

## Objectives
* Data Cleaning: To prepare raw data for analysis by removing inconsistencies and handling missing values.
* Data Analysis: To analyze the frequencies of different types of disasters and responses.
* Data Visualization: To visually represent the data through various charts, including bar charts, heatmaps, and time-series plots.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* pip (Python package installer)
